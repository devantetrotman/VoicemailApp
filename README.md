# Voicemail Application

![Voicemail Application Screenshot](images\VoicemailApplicationScreenshot.png)

This application allows the user to dial a number and emulate a call. If the number does not match a number saved in the contact list, the call will fail stating the number is not in service. If the number does match a contact number, the call will be successful emulating a ringing noise and playing the voicemail associated with that contact. 

There are 3 screens associated with this application: the Contacts Screen, Keypad Screen, and Call History Screen. 

## Contacts Screen

## Keypad Screen
